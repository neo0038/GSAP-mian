# GSAP Animations Project

This project demonstrates various animation techniques using GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform). Each example showcases a different method provided by GSAP, allowing you to create dynamic and engaging animations with ease.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several components, each focusing on a specific GSAP feature:

- **GSAP To**: Animates an element from its current state to a new state using `gsap.to()`.
- **GSAP From**: Reverses the animation, transitioning from a specified state back to the element's original state with `gsap.from()`.
- **GSAP FromTo**: Combines `from()` and `to()` methods, animating an element from one state to another and back.
- **GSAP Timeline**: Manages multiple animations in sequence using `gsap.timeline()`, allowing complex animation flows.
- **GSAP Stagger**: Staggers animations across multiple elements, creating a cascading effect with `gsap.stagger()`.
- **GSAP ScrollTrigger**: Triggers animations based on the scroll position using the ScrollTrigger plugin.
- **GSAP Text**: Demonstrates text animations with GSAP, including fades, slides, and more.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/gsap-animations.git
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Run the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

4. **Explore the animations**:
   Navigate to different routes to see each GSAP animation in action.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Animations**: Explore a wide range of animations, from simple transitions to complex sequences.
- **GSAP Stagger**: Apply staggered animations to multiple elements for visually appealing effects.
- **GSAP Timeline**: Manage multiple animations with a single timeline.
- **Text Animations**: Create engaging text animations with ease.
